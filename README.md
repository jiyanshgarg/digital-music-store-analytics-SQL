## Project Overview
Welcome to our music store data analysis project conducted using SQL! Our exploration delves into an extensive dataset comprising 11 tables, including Employee, Customer, Invoice, InvoiceLine, Track, MediaType, Genre, Album, Artist, PlaylistTrack, and Playlist.

Through the application of SQL queries, this project aims to unravel valuable insights and answer numerous critical questions about our music store's operations. By diving deep into the dataset, we aspire to gain profound understanding and enhance decision-making processes within the realm of our music retail venture.
