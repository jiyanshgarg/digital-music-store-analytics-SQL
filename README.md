# Digital Music Store 
The Digital Music Store sells a wide variety of music, including albums, tracks, and playlists. It also 
allows customers to create their own playlists. The store has a large number of employees, who 
work at multiple locations in Canada. The store also has a large number of customers

## Project Overview
Welcome to our music store data analysis project conducted using SQL! Our exploration delves into an extensive dataset comprising 11 tables, including Employee, Customer, Invoice, InvoiceLine, Track, MediaType, Genre, Album, Artist, PlaylistTrack, and Playlist.

Through the application of SQL queries, this project aims to unravel valuable insights and answer numerous critical questions about our music store's operations. By diving deep into the dataset, we aspire to gain profound understanding and enhance decision-making processes within the realm of our music retail venture.
